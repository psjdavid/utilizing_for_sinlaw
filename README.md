# Utilizing_through_sinelaw
These are some ways to utilize sin law with 'self-evident natures of a triangle'.

$$1. \sin B \times c = \sin C \times b$$

$$2. \sin B : \sin C = c:b$$

For this, we can solve the Ratio between two sine values with two line values.\
If there's a question like 'c=4, b=6. Solve the ratio between sin B and sin C.', we should take account of 'sine law'first.\
Then the standard approach is like this; 

$$\frac{6}{\sin B}=\frac{4}{\sin C}$$

$$\sin C \times 6 = \sin B \times 4$$

$$\sin C : \sin B = 4 : 6$$

$$\therefore \sin B : \sin C = 3 : 2$$

But with the method above, we can find the ratio between sin B and sin C is 3 : 2 easily because the raio between line band line c is ratio 3 : 2.\
Before, we couldn't know relation between 'the ratio between angles B and C' and 'the ratio between lines c and b'.\
However, we do not olny know the relation, but also calculate them!\
I will update this repository whenever it needs to be modified. Thnak you.
